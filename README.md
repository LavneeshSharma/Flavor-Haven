# Food Delivery Project

## Structure
- `/frontend`: Contains the React-based frontend code.
- `/frontend/backend`: Contains the Express-based backend code.

## Why Combined?
- For simplicity in local development and showcasing the project.
- The backend and frontend are fully functional, and the structure can be refactored if needed.
